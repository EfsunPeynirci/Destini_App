## 📖 About the App
In this application, **we direct the story ourselves**. Each time you read it, you can come to a different conclusion in the story.

- When the app opens, it presents you with a piece of the story.  
- You are given two options to choose from, and your choice determines the next part of the story.  
- Each piece you choose leads to its sequel, and the **conclusion of the story is shaped by your decisions**.

Every time you play, the story can take you on a different journey, leading to unique and unexpected endings!
