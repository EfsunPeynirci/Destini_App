# Destini

In this application, we direct the story ourselves. And each time you read it, you can come to a different conclusion in the story.

When we open the app it gives us a piece of the story. We choose one of the options given to us to continue the story. Each piece we choose takes us to its sequel. In this way, we make the conclusion of the story ourselves.

Each time we read the story, it can lead us to a different conclusion.
